Un groupe de communication francophone en contact avec l'équipe américaine s'est constitué afin de traduire les messages de comm de Firefox pour les comptes Facebook et Twitter. 

Un nouveau mode de travail a été instauré, les messages de communication à traduire seront envoyés par notre contact de l'équipe américaine (un mois au préalable) et pourront alors être traduit avant une deadline.

Voici le lien pour le &quot;pad&quot; de travail français : http://mzl.la/french-social.

##Mode d'emploi préconisé par M.J. Kelly & Elizabeth Hull
Here is how social media content localization occurs each month:

__THE MASSIVE SPREADSHEET__

    Once all of the content has been finalized and planned for the month on our end, 
    I email each language team, sharing the social media calendar, which is a Google 
    spreadsheet. The social media calendar is organized with source content on the 
    EN-master tab. Each language has its own tab that pulls in the EN source.

    Here's the link to the French tab: http://mzl.la/french-social. This is the only 
    tab you will need to work in.

    __Most important columns__: [Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0ynEphbdKOhZ0JCRVdTRzljZk0/view)
        Column E = notes to localizers, exactly as it sounds. Here I will include notes 
        about character limit,
        language requirements, questions about content appropriateness, etc.
        Column F = The EN source.
        Column G = This is where you will write your localized copy.
        Column H = Generally, this is where I would include a request for additional copy 
        that needs to be 
        localized for a graphic. An example is a quote or famous expression graphic.
        Column I = Where you would put your localized version of Column H.

    Less important columns, for your background, as needed:
        Column J = The URL where we will send users.
        Column L = The type of creative that will accompany the post, if at all.
        Column M = The creative bug where I work with the graphic designer on the asset.

    Note: We use formulas to populate each tab, so take care not to over-write them. If 
    that happens, it's not too difficult to correct. The sheet uses conditional formatting, 
    so you will notice that the cell is grayed out if no content is needed or it is pale 
    yellow where content is still needed. No need to change the cell colors as that will 
    happen automatically.

__LOCALIZING AND EDITING__

We recommend that some people write, and others edit. That can change monthly or you can choose designated roles. It's entirely up to your group. The main recommendation is that you should have someone else read the drafted work and make any needed changes before submitting it.

__DEADLINES__

In general, I request the localization be completed in two batches. For March, the deadlines are:

    Rows 101 - 118 by Feb. 25
    Rows 119 - 136 by March 11

You are, of course, welcome to complete all of the work in one batch. Some teams finish it all in a day; others take the full time period. Send me a note when the batch is done. I will also check in if I don't hear from the team.

__QUESTIONS__

If you ever have any questions or concerns at all, just reach out to me: mjkelly@mozilla.com. I am very interested in hearing ideas for content that would have local appeal throughout the year, just be sure to give me enough notice to slot it into the schedule and request graphics.

__MARCH CONTENT__

March content is in place, ready and waiting for you! Feel free to jump in there and get started once the team works out an editing process.

Thanks again,
